        <p>My name is <em>Minh Duy Nguyen</em>, I'm an international student from Vietnam which is small and unique
        culture country in <em>South-East Asia</em>. I have been in Canada since <abbr title="Sepmtember">Sep</abbr><sup>6</sup> 2018. In the first year, I have done grade 10 at Langley Secondary school in
        Vancouver where I think it had the best weather in <i>Canada</i>. But I decided to leave my lovely teacher and
        some of my best friend to move to <em>Ottawa</em> to continue grade 11 and 12 at <abbr title="Brookfield high school"> BHS</abbr> where
        I met a lot of friendly new friends. I just graduated from my high school program. Now, I am currently a
        student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IDM</abbr> program at Algonquin college.</p>
        <p>I have never been interested in studying until I mature enough to seriously think about my future. I
        know what I would love to do in my future and I decided to pursue it. I once heard a very good quote that is <q>If you <b>give up</b>, remember the <b>reason</b> you started</q>.- <cite>Vincent Owee</cite>, and i still remember that like a like a saying that I must always keep in my mind. I love to working with the camera,
        love to creative the video and websites, that's why I chose Interactive Media Design, and in my future I would like to
        become a professional designer and I will try to follow my passion. <strong>I'm not good at any particular thing, but i believe that if i put my efforts on any thing i can do it really well.</strong></p>
